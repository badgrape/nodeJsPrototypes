# nodeJsPrototypes

`index.js` and `index.html` make up a simple AJAX-Node.js web application. 

* Run `protoschema.sql` on your database server.
* Add your database credentials to `index.js`.
* Run `node index.js` on the command line, and keep your terminal handy to view the output.
* Open `index.html` in your browser and submit some form data. Open the developer tools console to view data logged on the client side.

Enjoy!
